## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project scaffolded from the `web-app` workspace template.
- Radar that reads ~50 sources (RSS, Google News, Telegram, YouTube) every 5 minutes.
- Relevance scoring against the group's shared links with a multilingual language model.
- Same-story grouping, big-story detection and one-notification-per-story pushes.
- Automatic self-learning from community sources, big stories and copy taps.
- iPhone home-screen app with copy button, tabs, search and notification sign-up.
- 11 more Danish sources; liveblog/sport/celebrity filter; at most 4 'Vigtigste' cards per source a day.
- Trust labels: 'Bekræftet af N medier' / 'Ubekræftet · kun Telegram/YouTube'.
- Optional Danish mode (offline English-to-Danish translation, WhatsApp-ready copy with bold headline).
- Arabic/Turkish setting: translate, hide or show original.
- Claude editor routine writes 'Dagens overblik' at 07 and 17 to the `digest` branch; the app shows it and notifies.
- Claude caretaker routine checks the radar daily, repairs or disables broken sources, logs to docs/radar-status.md.
- Stale-data warning in the app; per-source failure counts; manual push-test workflow.
- Renamed the app to Nabd with a pulse icon; compact, text-first, minimal list design (headline + one meta line
  with small indicators, relevance bar, tap to expand, copy icon and swipe-to-copy).
- Big stories now also need clear relevance (80th percentile) before they are shown or learned from.
